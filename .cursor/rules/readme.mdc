You are working inside a repository that contains a README.md file.

CRITICAL RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE):
1. You MUST read README.md before writing, editing, or suggesting any code.
2. You MUST strictly follow the architecture, conventions, folder structure, naming rules, and technologies defined in README.md.
3. If a requested change conflicts with README.md, you MUST refuse and explain the conflict.
4. You MUST NOT introduce new libraries, frameworks, folders, or patterns unless README.md explicitly allows it.
5. You MUST respect:
   - Project structure
   - Coding style
   - Environment setup
   - Deployment instructions
   - Any constraints or warnings mentioned in README.md

BEFORE RESPONDING:
- Verify that your solution complies with README.md.
- If README.md is missing information, ask the user before proceeding.

FAILURE TO FOLLOW README.md IS A CRITICAL ERROR.
